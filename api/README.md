# The API Module ðŸ”Œ

This module contains all the code for serving up data to endpoints using the queries and serialization models defined in the `db` module. The functions in `routes` directly correspond to the endpoints defined in the spec. Please ensure that the docstrings for these functions contain the endpoint, so that we do not have to go `grepping` through sourcecode.
